# Project_5
Change our Dictionary type for our Encounter and Inventory to std::map. This will
involve you REMOVING the dictionary object as well as the vector / stack files as 
appropriate since they will not be needed any more. You will have to completely replace
your implementation of these.

Files to be changed for this are dictionary.hpp, encounter.hpp, and inventory.hpp
